# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I productively struggled with making the values for every key in the objects lesson. I wanted to make sure the value made sense for the key.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I'm getting more used to note taking. I find writing terminology down is helping me become better at technically describing the code I'm writing. I take the most helpful notes at the beginning of the lesson when the new vocabulary is being explained.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I definitely try to solve the problem on Replit first. I only start Googling when I find my self wasting time with unproductive struggle.
